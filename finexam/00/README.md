# Final for CS391X1, Summer I, 2025

## Date: Wednesday, the 25th of June, 2025

## How to submit?

Please submit into the folder `Final` on the Gradescope page for
this class. All of your submitted code should be stored in a file of
the name `finexam.py` located in the director `finexam/01/MySolution`.

## Description of the task

### Task 1

This task is worth 100 points.

Please study the code in `lecture-06-18/lambda3.py`, which contains a
partially implemented compiler for the LAMBDA language used during the
midterm. Your task is to complete the missing cases in this
implementation: TMtup, TMfst, TMsnd, TMlet, and TMopr (for various
operators). I expect that your completed implementation can handle the
8-queen puzzle solution you did for the midterm.

### Task 2

This task is worth 200 points.

Please implement a function `tcmp_pyemit` that takes a _computation_
returned by the aforementioned compiler and outputs some python code
that implements the computation.  I expect that your completed
implementation of `tcmp_pyemit` can handle the 8-queen puzzle solution
you did for the midterm.

### Task 3

This task is worth 100 points.

Please write a short report (about 5 pages) that documents the compiler
you implement. I expect that you give clear description of your work in
the report. In particular, I expect that proper English is used; I do not
want to read the kind of broken English one often sees in on-line chats.
