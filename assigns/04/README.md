# Assignment 4 for CS391X1, Summer I, 2025

## Total points: 100

## Description of the task

During lecture-06-16 and lecture-06-17, we covered a method for
compiling LAMBDA into C that makes use of boxed data representation.
Please see `lecture-06-16/fact_out.c` and `lecture-06-16/fact2_out.c`
for some concrete examples illustrating this method.

### Task 1 (50 Points)

This task tests your basic understanding of data boxing
and unboxing.

Please implement the following function by following the coding
style used in `lecture-06-16/fact_out.c`.

```
fun f91(x: int): int =
  if x > 100 then x-10 else f91(f91(x+11))
```

Note that your implementation of `f91` should have the following
interface in C:

```
extern lamval1 f91(lamval1 x);
```

### Task 2 (50 Points)

This task tests your basic understanding of `term_comp00`.

The following function `isPrime` tests whether a given number `n`
is a prime number:

```
fun isPrime(n: int): bool =
let
  fun helper(p: int): bool =
    if p * p > n
    then true else
    (if n % p = 0 then false else helper(p+1))
in
  if n >= 2 then helper(2) else false
end

```

Note the presence of an inner function `helper` in the body of
`isPrime`.  Please first study the implementation of `term_comp00` in
`lecture-06-18/lambda3.py`, and then _manually_ translate `isPrime`
into some Python code that _roughly_ corresponds the code generated by
`term_comp00` from compiling a function in LAMBDA that corresponds to
`isPrime`.

### Submission

You are expected to have all of your submitted code in one file of
the name `assign03.py`; this file should be stored in the directory
of the name `assigns/03/MySolution`. Please visit the following page

class:
